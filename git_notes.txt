Pull requests are how you merge branches on github

Git hub is a hub of .gits/directories

you can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories

you can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths

master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit

Head is not a branch

# creates a new branch called git notes
git-branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch
